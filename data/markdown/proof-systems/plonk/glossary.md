* cell = a pair (row, column)
* witness = the values assigned in all the cells
* gate = polynomials that act on the variables in a row
* selector vector = a vector of values 1 or 0 (not true for constant vector I think) that toggles gates and variables in a row
* gadget = a series of contiguous rows with some specific gates set (via selector vectors)
