# Pickles

Pickles is Minaâ€™s inductive zk-SNARK composition system. It lets you construct proofs with zk-SNARKs and combine them in flexible ways to deliver incremental verifiable computation.

---

Pickles uses a pair of amicable curves called [Pasta](../pasta_curves.md) in order to deliver incremental verifiable computation efficiently.

These curves are referred to as "tick" and "tock" within the Mina source code.

* Tick - Vesta (a.k.a. Step), constraint domain size $2^{18}$ [block and transaction proofs]
* Tock - Pallas (a.k.a. Wrap), constraint domain size $2^{17}$ [signatures]

The Tock prover does less (only performs recursive verifications and no other logic), so it requires fewer constraints and has a smaller domain size.  Internally Pickles refers to Tick and Tock as Step and Wrap, respectively.

Tock is used to prove the verification of a Tick proof and outputs a Tick proof.  Tick is used to prove the verification of a Tock proof and outputs a Tock proof.  In other words,

* $\mathtt{Prove}_{tock}(\mathtt{Verify}(Tick)) = Tick_{proof}$
* $\mathtt{Prove}_{tick}(\mathtt{Verify}(Tock)) = Tock_{proof}$

Both Tick and Tock can verify at most 2 proofs of the opposite kind, though, theoretically more is possible.

Currently, in Mina we have the following situation.

* Every Tock always wraps 1 Tick proof, such as
* Tick proofs can verify 2 Tock proofs
  * Blockchain SNARK takes previous blockchain SNARK proof and a transaction proof
  * Verifying two Tock transaction proofs
