# Circuit generation

In circuit generation mode, the `has_witness` field of `RunState` is set to the default `CircuitGeneration`, and the program of the user is ran to completion.

During the execution, the different snarky functions called on `RunState` will create [internal variables](./vars.md) as well as constraints.

## Creation of variables

[Variables](./vars.md) can be created via the `compute()` function, which takes two arguments:

* A `TypeCreation` toggle, which is either set to `Checked` or `Unsafe`. We will describe this below.
* A closure representing the actual computation behind the variable. This computation will only take place when real values are computed, and can be non-deterministic (e.g. random, or external values provided by the user). Note that the closure takes one argument: a `WitnessGeneration`, a structure that allows you to read the runtime values of any variables that were previously created in your program.

The `compute()` function also needs a type hint to understand what type of [snarky type](./vars.md#snarky-vars) it is creating.

It then performs the following steps:

* creates enough [`CVar`](./vars#circuit-vars) to hold the value to be created 
* retrieves the auxiliary data needed to create the snarky type (TODO: explain auxiliary data) and create the [`snarky variable`](./vars.md#snarky-vars) out of the `CVar`s and the auxiliary data
* if the `TypeCreation` is set to `Checked`, call the `check()` function on the snarky type (which will constrain the value created), if it is set to `Unsafe` do nothing (in which case we're trusting that the value cannot be malformed, this is mostly used internally and it is highly-likely that users directly making use of `Unsafe` are writing bugs)

```admonish
At this point we only created variables to hold future values, and made sure that they are constrained.
The actual values will fill the room created by the `CVar` only during the [witness generation](./witness-generation.md).
```

## Constraints

All other functions exposed by the API are basically here to operate on variables and create constraints in doing so.
