# On-Chain Values

You can access the current [on-chain state](/zkapps/how-to-write-a-zkapp#on-chain-state) of a zkApp account. Similarly, you can access many other on-chain values in a zkApp.

Just to give you an idea, here are two possible use cases:

- You want to let users vote on a proposal, but only within a specific timespan. To restrict the dates, you can make your zkApp require that the current timestamp lies in a certain range.
- In DeFi, you might need to compute amounts relative to a balance. For example, paying a yield of `0.001` times the account balance requires you to get the current on-chain balance.

There are two categories of on-chain values:

- **Network**: includes the current timestamp, block height, total Mina in circulation, and other network state
- **Account**: includes fields and properties of the zkApp account, such as balance, nonce, and delegate

The subfields of both categories are accessible on `this.network` and `this.account` in a smart contract.
For example, the timestamp on `this.network.timestamp` has four methods:

```ts
this.network.timestamp.get();
this.network.timestamp.assertEquals(timestamp);
this.network.timestamp.assertBetween(lower, upper);
```

The familiar on-chain state has the same `get()` and `assertEquals()` methods. The `assertBetween()` method has even more power: it allows you to make assert that the timestamp is between `lower` and `upper` (inclusive).

### Example: restricting timestamps

You can see how to use the `assertBetween()` method in the voting example that was mentioned earlier. Assume you want to allow voting throughout September 2022. Timestamps are represented as a `UInt64` in milliseconds since the [UNIX epoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time). You can use the JS `Date` object to easily convert to this representation. In the simplest case, a zkApp could just hard-code the dates:

```ts
const startDate = UInt64.from(Date.UTC(2022, 9, 1));
const endDate = UInt64.from(Date.UTC(2022, 10, 1));

class VotingApp extends SmartContract {
  // ...

  @method vote(...) {
    this.network.timestamp.assertBetween(startDate, endDate);
    // ...
  }
}
```

A more refined example could store the current start date in an on-chain state variable, which can then be reset by some process that is also encoded by the zkApp.

In addition to using a predefined range, you can also construct a range that depends on another variable, such as the current time. For example, a DEX with an order book could support orders that expire after an hour. In this case, the range would be `[now, now + 1h]`:

```ts
const now = this.network.timestamp.get();
this.network.timestamp.assertBetween(now, now.add(60 * 60 * 1000));
```

### Network reference

For completeness, here is the full list of network states you can use and make assertions about in your zkApp.

All of these fields have a `get()` and an `assertEquals()` method. The subset that represents
"ordered values" (those that are `UInt32` or `UInt64`) also have `assertBetween()`.

Of course, there's no need to remember this -- just type `this.network.` and let intelligent code complete guide you!

```ts
// current UNIX time in milliseconds, as measured by the block producer
this.network.timestamp.get(): UInt64;
// length of the blockchain, also known as block height
this.network.blockchainLength.get(): UInt32;
// total minted currency measured in units of 1e-9 MINA
this.network.totalCurrency.get(): UInt64;
// slots since genesis / hardfork -- a "slot" is the Mina-native time unit of 3 minutes
this.network.globalSlotSinceGenesis.get(): UInt32;
this.network.globalSlotSinceHardFork.get(): UInt32;
// hash of the snarked ledger -- i.e., the state of Mina included in the blockchain proof
this.network.snarkedLedgerHash.get(): Field;
// minimum window density in our consensus algorithm
this.network.minWindowDensity.get(): UInt32;
// consensus data relevant to the current staking epoch
this.network.stakingEpochData.ledger.hash.get(): Field;
this.network.stakingEpochData.ledger.totalCurrency.get(): UInt64;
this.network.stakingEpochData.epochLength.get(): UInt32;
this.network.stakingEpochData.seed.get(): Field;
this.network.stakingEpochData.lockCheckpoint.get(): Field;
this.network.stakingEpochData.startCheckpoint.get(): Field;
// consensus data relevant to the next, upcoming staking epoch
this.network.nextEpochData.ledger.hash.get(): Field;
this.network.nextEpochData.ledger.totalCurrency.get(): UInt64;
this.network.nextEpochData.epochLength.get(): UInt32;
this.network.nextEpochData.seed.get(): Field;
this.network.nextEpochData.lockCheckpoint.get(): Field;
this.network.nextEpochData.startCheckpoint.get(): Field;
```

### Account reference

Here's the full list of values you can access on the zkApp account. Like the network states, these values have `get()` and `assertEquals()`.
Balance and nonce also have `assertBetween()`.

```ts
// the account balance; this might be nanoMINA or a custom token
this.account.balance.get(): UInt64;
// account nonce -- increases by 0 or 1 in every transaction
this.account.nonce.get(): UInt32;
// the account the zkApp delegates its stake to (default: its own address)
this.account.delegate.get(): PublicKey;
// boolean indicating whether an account is new (= didn't exist before the transaction)
this.account.isNew.get(): Bool;
// boolean indicating whether all 8 on-chain state fields where last changed by a transaction
// authorized by a zkApp proof (as opposed to a signature)
this.account.provedState.get(): Bool;
// hash receipt which includes all prior transaction to an account
this.account.receiptChainHash.get(): Field;
```

### Bailing out

In some rare cases, you might, for whatever reason, want to `get()` an on-chain value _without_ constraining it to any value.
If you try this, SnarkyJS throws a helpful error reminding you to use `assertEquals()` and `asserBetween()`.
As an escape hatch, if you want to `get()` a value and are really sure you want to not constrain the on-chain value in any way,
there's `assertNothing()` on all of these fields (including on-chain state). **Use at your own risk.**

:::danger

`assertNothing()` should be rarely used and could cause security issues through unexpected behavior if used improperly. Be certain you know what you're doing before using this.

### Setting account fields

Just like on-chain state, some account fields can be written to. Again, the API is consistent with state: `this.account.<field>.set(newValue)`.

For example, here's how to change permissions on an account:

```ts
this.account.permissions.set({
  ...Permissions.default(),
  setVerificationKey: Permissions.impossible(),
});
```

And here's how to set the delegate (the account that your smart contract delegates its stake to):

```ts
this.account.delegate.set(delegatePublicKey);
```

The fields that you can set are not the same as the fields that you can make assertions about. Here is the full list of fields that have a `.set()`:

```ts
// the account that this account delegates its MINA stake to
this.account.delegate.set(value: PublicKey);
// the verification key
this.account.verificationKey.set(value: VerificationKey);
// account permissions, to control authorization for performing actions on the account
this.account.permissions.set(value: Permissions);
// currently unused - could become URL holding zkApp metadata
this.account.zkappUri.set(value: string);
// token symbol of the token owned by this account â€” only relevant for token contracts!
this.account.tokenSymbol.set(value: string);
// parameters to control a vesting schedule, used in time-locked accounts
this.account.timing.set(value: Timing);
```

### Accessing accounts other than the zkApp's account

The API described in this section (get / set / assertEquals / ...) can be used to access the zkApp account itself, but also any other account.
To do so, create an [account update](/zkapps/how-to-write-a-zkapp#transactions-and-account-updates) to find the same `account` / `network` fields API:

```ts
let accountUpdate = AccountUpdate.create(address);

// use the balance of this account
let balance = accountUpdate.account.balance.get();
accountUpdate.account.balance.assertEquals(balance);

// assert that this account is new
accountUpdate.account.isNew.assertEquals(Bool(true));

// set permissions this account
accountUpdate.account.permissions.set(permissions);
```

:::tip
When setting fields on an account update, you have to make sure that this _same_ account update has the correct authorization to perform those actions.
For example, to initially set the verification key, the update requires a signature from the account owner:

```ts
// use createSigned to require a signature
let accountUpdate = AccountUpdate.createSigned(address);

// set the verification key on the account; could be used to deploy a zkApp from a zkApp
accountUpdate.account.verificationKey.set(vk);
```
