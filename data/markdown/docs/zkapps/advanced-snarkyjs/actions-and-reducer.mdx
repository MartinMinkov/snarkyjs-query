# Actions & Reducer

Like events, **actions** are _public_ arbitrary information that are passed along with a zkApp transaction. However, actions give you additional power: you can process previous actions in a smart contract! Under the hood, this is possible because a commitment is stored to the history of dispatched actions on every account -- the **actionState**. It allows you to prove that the actions you process are, in fact, the actions that were dispatched to the same smart contract.

Using actions and a "lagging state" pattern, you can write zkApps that can _process concurrent state updates by multiple users_. With this capability, you can imagine all kinds of use cases where actions act as a built-in, "append-only" off-chain storage layer.

To use actions, we first have to declare their type on the smart contract. The object we declare is called a **reducer** -- because it can take a list of actions and reduce them:

```ts
import { SmartContract, Reducer, Field } from 'snarkyjs';

class MyContract extends SmartContract {
  reducer = Reducer({ actionType: Field });
}
```

Contrary to events, for actions you only have one type per smart contract; they also don't have a name. The `actionType` in this example is `Field`.

On a `reducer`, you have two functions: `reducer.dispatch()` and `reducer.reduce()`. "Dispatch" is simple -- like emitting events, it pushes one additional action to your account's action history:

```ts
this.reducer.dispatch(Field(1000));
```

"Reduce" is more involved, but it gives you full power to process actions however it suits your application. It might be easiest to grasp from an example. Say we have a list of actions and want to find out if one of them is equal to `1000`. In JavaScript, there's a built-in function on `Array` which does this:

```ts
let has1000 = array.some((x) => x === 1000);
```

However, as you might know, you can also implement this with `Array.reduce`:

```ts
let has1000 = array.reduce((acc, x) => acc || x === 1000, false);
```

In fact, `Array.reduce` is powerful enough to let you do pretty much all array processing you can think of. With `Reducer.reduce`, we give you an in-snark operation which is just as powerful:

```ts
// type for the "accumulated output" of reduce -- the `stateType`
let stateType = Bool;

// example actions data
let actions = [[Field(1000)], [Field(2)], [Field(100)]];

// state and actionState before applying actions
let initial = {
  state: Bool(false),
  actionState: Reducer.initialActionState,
};

let { state, actionState } = this.reducer.reduce(
  actions,
  stateType,
  (state: Bool, action: Field) => state.or(action.equals(1000)),
  initial
);
```

The `acc` shown earlier is now `state`; you also have to pass in the state's type as a parameter. In addition, you have to pass in an `actionState` which refers to one particular point in the action's history. Like `Array.reduce`, `Reducer.reduce` takes a callback that has the signature `(state: S, action: A) => S`, where `S` is the `stateType` and `A` is the `actionType`. It returns the result of applying all the actions, in order, to the initial `state`. In this example, the returned `state` is `Bool(true)` because one of the actions in the list is `Field(1000)`. Reduce also returns the new actionState -- so you can store it to use when you reduce the next batch of actions. One last difference to JS reduce is that this takes a _list of lists_ of actions instead of a flat list. Each of the sublists are the actions that were dispatched in one account update (for example, while running one smart contract method).

As an astute reader, you might have noticed that this use of `state` is eerily similar to a standard "Elm architecture" -- this similarity is because an instance of a scan over an implicit infinite stream of actions (though here that are aggregated in chunks). This is very similar to the problem that came up when processing transactions within the [Mina Protocol L1 with Snark Workers](https://minaprotocol.com/blog/fast-accumulation-on-streams). This may sound scary, but it is familiar to web developers through its instantiation by using the Redux library or more recently by using the `useReducer` hook in React!

There is one interesting nuance here when compared to traditional Elm Architecture/Redux/useReducer instantiations: Because we're handling multiple actions concurrently in an undefined order, it is important that actions [commute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutative_property) against any possible state to prevent race conditions in your zkApp. Given any two actions a1 and a2 applying to some state s, `s * a1 * a2` means the same as `s * a2 * a1`.

:::tip

A zkApp can retrieve events and actions from one or more Mina archive nodes. If your smart contract needs to fetch events and actions from an archive node, see [How to Fetch Events and Actions](fetch-events-and-actions).

### Reducer - API reference

```ts
reducer = Reducer({ actionType: AsFieldElements<A> });

this.reducer.dispatch(action: A): void;

this.reducer.reduce<S>(
  actions: A[][],
  stateType: AsFieldElements<S>,
  reduce: (state: S, action: A) => S,
  initial: { state: S, actionState: Field }
): { state: S, actionState: Field };

Reducer.initialActionState: Field;
```

In the near future, we want to add a function to retrieve actions from an archive node:

```ts
this.reducer.getActions({ fromActionState?: Field, endActionState?: Field }): A[][];
```

Right now, `getActions` is available for [testing with `LocalBlockchain`](/zkapps/how-to-test-a-zkapp).

### Actions for concurrent state updates

One of the most important use cases for actions is to enable concurrent state updates. This enablement is also why actions were originally added to the protocol.

A detailed explanation of the problem, and how actions can provide the solution, can be found here: https://github.com/o1-labs/snarkyjs/issues/265#issuecomment-1177512908

You can see a [full code example](https://github.com/o1-labs/snarkyjs/blob/main/src/examples/zkapps/reducer/reducer.ts) that demonstrates this pattern. Leveraging `Reducer.reduce()`, it takes only about 30 lines of code to build a zkApp that handles concurrent state updates.
